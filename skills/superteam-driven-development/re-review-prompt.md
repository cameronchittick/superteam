# Scoped Re-Review Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a re-review after a fix round. The
re-reviewer verifies the findings were addressed and checks the fix diff for
new breakage. It is not a fresh review — the full review already happened.

A fix round re-opens **only the axis that failed**. Fill one re-reviewer per
failed axis and name that axis in `[AXIS]`: the spec seat re-checks spec
findings, the standards seat re-checks standards findings, and neither
inherits the other's list. If both axes failed, dispatch two.

**Purpose:** Verify each finding from the previous review was addressed, and
that the fix itself broke nothing.

```
Agent:
  name: "task-N-rereview-[AXIS]-R"  # no isolation: read-only, runs as a teammate
  subagent_type: "superteam:reviewer"  # general-purpose if the plugin agent is not loaded
  description: "Re-review Task N [AXIS] axis, fix round R"
  model: [omit to take the agent's default; override only with a Model Selection reason written here]
  prompt: |
    You are re-reviewing one task's fix round on the **[AXIS]** axis (spec or
    standards). A previous review of that axis produced findings; an
    implementer has attempted to fix them. Your job is to verdict each
    finding and inspect the fix diff — nothing else. The other axis is
    another seat's business; never rerank across the two.

    ## Claiming Your Task

    Team mode: you claimed `Task N: review [AXIS] R [reviewer]`; the
    description's `Reviews:` line names the branch. Fallback mode: if
    `TaskUpdate` is available, set owner=<your name>, status=in_progress
    before starting; status=completed only after your verdict is written.

    ## Task Brief

    [TASK_BRIEF — paste the output of scripts/task-brief --print PLAN N verbatim]

    ## The Findings Under Verification

    [FINDINGS]

    ## The Fix

    Read the implementer's report (fix reports are appended at the end;
    the lead copied it out of the worktree to [REPORT_FILE] in this
    checkout before dispatching you):
    [REPORT_FILE]

    **Fix base:** [FIX_BASE_SHA] (the head the previous review saw)
    **Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
    **Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

    Read the diff file once — it contains the fix commits, a stat summary,
    and the fix diff with surrounding context. Do not re-run git commands.
    If the diff file is missing, fetch the diff yourself:
    `git diff --stat [FIX_BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]` and
    `git diff [FIX_BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`.

    Your review is read-only on this checkout. Do not mutate the working
    tree, the index, HEAD, or branch state in any way.

    ## You Do Not Dispatch Subagents

    Do all of this review yourself. Never spawn a subagent to review part
    of the diff, and never spawn another reviewer for a second opinion.
    This process already provides every review seat the work gets; a
    reviewer you spawn duplicates one of them at full cost, and its
    verdict counts for nothing. If the diff feels too large for one
    pass, review it in passes yourself and say so in your report.

    ## Scope

    Your scope is the findings list and the fix diff. Verdict every finding.
    Inspect the fix diff for new problems the fix itself introduced. Do NOT
    re-review code the fix did not touch: if you notice an issue entirely
    outside the fix diff, report it under Out-of-Scope Observations — it
    does not block this task and does not extend the loop. A broad
    whole-branch review happens after all tasks are complete.

    ## Tests

    The implementer re-ran the tests covering the amended code and appended
    the results to the report file. Treat the report as unverified claims:
    confirm the fix report names the covering tests and shows their output,
    and verify the claims against the diff. Do not re-run the suite to
    confirm their report. Run a test only when reading the code raises a
    specific doubt that no existing run answers — and then a focused test,
    never a package-wide suite.

    ## Output Format

    Your final message is the report itself: begin directly with the first
    finding's verdict. Every line is a verdict, a finding with file:line,
    or a check you ran — no preamble, no process narration.

    ### Finding Verdicts

    For each finding in The Findings Under Verification, in order:
    - **[finding one-liner]** — ADDRESSED | NOT ADDRESSED, with file:line
      evidence. "Attempted" is not addressed: the specific defect must no
      longer exist.

    ### New Breakage in the Fix Diff

    Anything the fix itself broke or introduced, with severity
    (Critical/Important/Minor) and file:line. "None" if clean.

    ### Out-of-Scope Observations

    Issues you noticed entirely outside the fix diff. Non-blocking; the
    controller ledgers these for the final review. "None" if none.

    Register: code specifics for the team lead — file:line, diff, severity — answer first; see agents/reviewer.md "Report register".

    ### Verdict

    **Fix round:** [All findings addressed, no new Critical/Important
    breakage | Findings remain open] — list the open ones.
```

**Placeholders:**
- `[AXIS]` — REQUIRED: `spec` or `standards`, the one axis this round
  re-opens. One re-reviewer per failed axis; a passing axis is not re-run
- `model` — omit; the agent file carries the default, which suits a scoped
  re-review. Override only with a reason from SKILL.md Model Selection
- `[TASK_BRIEF]` — the same inlined brief text the implementer worked from
  (`scripts/task-brief --print PLAN_FILE N`)
- `[FINDINGS]` — the Critical/Important findings and spec gaps from the
  previous review, copied verbatim, one per bullet
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — the implementer's report file, copied out of the
  worktree into this checkout (fix reports appended)
- `[FIX_BASE_SHA]` — the head the previous review saw
- `[HEAD_SHA]` — current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — the path `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD` printed

**Re-reviewer returns:** per-finding verdicts (ADDRESSED / NOT ADDRESSED),
new breakage in the fix diff, out-of-scope observations, and a round verdict.
